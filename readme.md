This is my code pool for Arduino projects.

It's a mess. It contains noobish and quick-and-dirty sketches.
I'm not having much experience in C/CPP programming so my code
style and programs design are still forming.

All not my libraries are excluded. If some sketch using them,
you need to find and install them by yourself.
