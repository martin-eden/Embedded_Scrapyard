RBG LED stripe facade. Design notes.

Facade

Okay I want

  Serial text interface to control RGB LED stripe.

  It should be human controllable, moderately verbose output,
  terse input.

Example

  <
    .
  >
    wtf
  <
    Sorry can't parse "wtf".
  >
    ?
  <
    ?

    Available commands are

      ? - usage help
      S - State (or Status or Set) - represent/modify current state
      R - Run - write state to LED stripe
    .
  >
    ?
  <
    ? ?

    Hello there!

    I am text interface for LED stripe.

    I am not very chatty because of general no-nonsense attitude.

    But there is one more command you need to know:

      ^ - go one level up

    And one more of my possible replies:

      - - please stop sending commands, I can't process them any more
      / - command is partly applied (can't revert, can't finish)
    .
  >
    ^
  <
    .
  >
    ?
  <
    ?

    Available commands are

      S - State (or Status or Set) - represent/modify current state
      R - Run - write state to LED stripe
      ? - usage help

    Led stripe:

      Output pin: 14
      Number of LEDs: 60

    Available commands are

      M - get/set Memory
      O - set Output pin
      N - set Number of LEDs
    .

    M ?
  <
    S M

    Memory range is [1, 60].

    Available commands are

      R - set Range
      D - Dump memory (180 bytes)
      S - set memory (180 bytes)
    .
  >
    R ?
  <
    S M R

    Enter two integers for subrange of [1, 60].
    .

    .
  >
    ?
  <
    S M

    Memory range is [1, 2].

    Available commands are

      R - set Range
      D - Dump memory (6 bytes)
      S - Set memory (6 bytes)

/*
  Well, a bit daunting but the interface is interesting.

  Probably tree should be

    ? - help
    S - Set/Status/Settings
      M - Memory
        R - Range
          G - Get
          S - Set
        G
        S
      O - Output pin
        G
        S
      N - Num leds
        G
        S
    R - Run
