# What to do when we don't have capacity to store entity?

Say our stream is

  "123 45"

and we are calling

  GetEntity(&Entity, &EntityLen, 2)  <- Entity capacity is 2 characters

What our call should return, place into <Entity> and what state of stream?

  true, "12", "3 45"

    Bad. Next call will return (true, "3", " 45"). We splat entity "123"
    to "12" and "3" because of our implementation details.

  true, "12", " 45"

    Practical. We trimmed entity "123" to "12". Implemented.

  false, "12", " 45"

    Not bad, but we are forcing our caller to check for empty stream
    before our call to understand that entry does not fit.

  true, "45", ""

    Somewhat correct. But we lost position in parsing entries sequence.
    That makes outer logic senseless.


# How to understand entry was trimmed?

You can't but I can offer practical workaround.

Say you are reading 3-character entries that are supposed to
store "0" .. "255".

Here we just want to read entries up to 3 characters.

We can set entry capacity to 4, so for

  "25501" it will set entry to "2550" and it's length to 4.

  Size 4 is more than allowed 3. So the entry is too big and maybe
  was trimmed.
