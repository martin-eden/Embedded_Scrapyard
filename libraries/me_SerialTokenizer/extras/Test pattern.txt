256 characters I used to see effect of Stream.setTimeout()

0123456789ABCDEF 123456789ABCDEF  23456789ABCDEF   3456789ABCDEF    456789ABCDEF     56789ABCDEF      6789ABCDEF       789ABCDEF        89ABCDEF         9ABCDEF          ABCDEF           BCDEF            CDEF             DEF              EF               F

Correct output of GetEntity() with entity size 8 is

(01234567)
(12345678)
(23456789)
(3456789A)
(456789AB)
(56789ABC)
(6789ABCD)
(789ABCDE)
(89ABCDEF)
(9ABCDEF)
(ABCDEF)
(BCDEF)
(CDEF)
(DEF)
(EF)
(F)

That was for timeout between 1 and 10 ms.
  20 ms are bad.
    Range between 10 and 20 ms is not explored.

So despite input buffer size of 64 bytes, code can handle longer
packets. Additional conditions apply.
